# Scale-change symmetry in the rules governing neural systems 

This project is done as part of my Phd thesis under the guidance of Dr.
work is motivated from experiments suggest that the cerebral cortex can also operate near a critical phase transition. It has been
observed in many physical systems that the governing physical laws obey a fractal symmetry near critical phase transition. This symmetry
exists irrespective of the observational length-scale.  Thus, we hypothesize that the laws governing cortical dynamics may obey
scale-change symmetry.  We test and confirm this hypothesis using two different computational models. Further, we extend the
transformational scheme show that as a mouse awakens from anesthesia, scale-change symmetry emerges.
