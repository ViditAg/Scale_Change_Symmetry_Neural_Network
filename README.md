# Scale-change symmetry in the rules governing neural systems 

This project is done as part of PhD thesis under the guidance of [Dr. Woodrow L. Shew](https://www.woodrowshew.com/) at University of Arkansas-Fayetteville. 
It is a part computational and part data-analysis project. This work is motivated from experiments suggest that the cerebral cortex can also operate near a critical phase transition. It has been observed in many physical systems that the governing physical laws obey a fractal symmetry near critical phase transition. This symmetry exists irrespective of the observational length-scale.  Thus, we hypothesize that the laws governing cortical dynamics may obey scale-change symmetry.  We test and confirm this hypothesis using two different computational models. Further, we extend the transformational scheme show that as a mouse awakens from anesthesia, scale-change symmetry emerges.

[Finally, this research work got published in iScience journal].(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004219300094?via%3Dihub). I have also attached a copy of this manuscript in the repository.

I also, presented this work at American Physical Society, March Meeting held in Los Angeles, California. The presentation is also attached in the repository.
